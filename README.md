Howdy ðŸ‘‹
After working on my `Little Bear` prompt, I decided to distill it down to something even smaller and simpler. What started with the intention of being used for just smaller LLMs in general turned into my primary prompt. I like things that are small and easy to parse/understand at a glance. Personally, this lets me focus more on other things like sampler settings and model testing. Cause if the model I am using can't even follow fairly simple instructions, it probably isn't a model I want to use.
