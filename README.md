Howdy ðŸ‘‹
After working on my `Little Bear` prompt, I decided to distill it down to something even smaller and simpler. What can I say, I have an obsession with making things smaller and simpler I guess. Just like my `Little Bear` prompt, the purpose of this was to create something simple enough for smaller local models to function with. However, there is only so much you can do to "unstupid" a small LLM model. This won't do magic. It's just meant to get the LLM to follow a certain style I like while being minimal...or...try to.
